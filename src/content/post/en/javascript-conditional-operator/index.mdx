Control flow is one of the essential concepts in programming languages. Besides using `if` and `else`, JavaScript offers a concise syntax: the conditional (ternary) operator.

As the name suggests, it consists of three parts: "condition, success flow, and failure flow." When a conditional expression is set. If the condition is true, the success flow is executed; otherwise, the failure flow is executed. The concept is similar to `if` and `else`, but the syntax of the conditional operator is more concise and can be completed in one line, making it a very popular and commonly used syntax.

```js
// Traditional syntax
const age = 18;
let result = '';

if (age >= 18) {
  result = 'Adult';
} else {
  result = 'Minor';
}
```

```js
// Condition ? Success flow : Failure flow
const age = 18;
const result = age >= 18 ? 'Adult' : 'Minor';
```

Using the conditional operator can significantly reduce the length of the code, similar to a mini version of `if` `else`.

## Common Mistakes

Besides simple control flow, **it is best not to use the conditional operator in overly complex situations, as it can make the code difficult to read; brevity does not always mean readability**.

```js
// Traditional syntax
const wallet = 100;
let result = '';

if (wallet >= 100) {
  result = 'Buy a hamburger';
} else if (wallet >= 50) {
  result = 'Buy a coffee';
} else {
  result = 'Can only drink water';
}
```

```js
// Conditional operator
const wallet = 100;
const result = wallet >= 100 ? 'Buy a hamburger' : wallet >= 50 ? 'Buy a coffee' : 'Can only drink water';
```
