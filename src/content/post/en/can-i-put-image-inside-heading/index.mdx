## Is it Compliant?

> Placing an image inside a heading is compliant syntax.

After researching and testing (using [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)), the conclusion is that putting an image inside a heading is 100% compliant syntax. Heading tags can accept inline elements, and `<img>` is an inline element, so it can be placed within heading tags.

## Is it a Good Practice?

> Although there is much debate online, Google Search Central's response is: "[This is a good practice](https://youtu.be/fBLvn_WkDJ4?t=29)"!

This means that the following syntax is valid and a good practice:

```html
<!-- ðŸ˜€ Good -->
<h1>
  <a href="/">
    <img src="logo.svg" alt="A company's LOGO" />
  </a>
</h1>

<h2>
  <img src="cat-with-sign.webp" alt="A cat holding a sign that says 'Adoption Information'" />
</h2>
```

Since the `alt` attribute for images has some [recommended rules to follow](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-images?hl=zh-tw#descriptive-alt-text), I can imagine that separating decorative images from headings and using CSS to hide the heading text could also be a good choice. For example, Bootstrap has [visually-hidden](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/helpers/visually-hidden/) and Tailwind has [sr-only](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/screen-readers) to make text visually hidden but semantically present.

```html
<h2 class="visually-hidden">Adoption Information</h2>
<img src="cat-with-sign.webp" alt="A cat holding a sign that says 'Adoption Information'" />
```
