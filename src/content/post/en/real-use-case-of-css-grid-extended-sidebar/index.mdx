## Introduction

Real-world web pages rarely require CSS Grid for special visuals. Recently, while creating some unique visual web layouts, I found it particularly suitable as an inspirational teaching material for CSS Grid. Thus, I wrote this article to help **deepen the understanding of CSS Grid through real-world cases**.

## Problem

Create two sizes of RWD pages based on the diagram.

![Problem Diagram](problem-demo.webp 'Problem Diagram')

## Solution

It becomes clear that this layout cannot be achieved using traditional one-dimensional layouts, as the containers they belong to differ between the two sizes.

For example, the `sidebar` should be contained within the `main` parent container, but it also needs to align with the top of `intro` on larger device sizes. Clearly, such a requirement is difficult to achieve with traditional CSS layouts, whether using negative `margin` to push elements or `position: absolute`, `transform`, which can lead to a messy and hard-to-maintain situation, even requiring JavaScript to calculate positions üòê.

At this point, we can **rely on CSS Grid to define a two-dimensional layout**, assigning child elements to their corresponding areas. Typically, I use tools like [CSS Grid Generator](https://grid.layoutit.com/) to set up the layout. Specifically, we can first outline the appearance of the grid:

```css
.grid {
  --max-width-main: 800px; /* Maximum width of main area */
  --width-sidebar: 400px; /* Sidebar width */
  --height-topbar: 40px; /* Topbar height */

  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns:
    1fr /* Left side can stretch */
    minmax(0, var(--max-width-main)) var(--width-sidebar) /* Main area auto-stretch with max width limit + sidebar */
    1fr; /* Right side can stretch */
  grid-template-rows: var(--height-topbar) 1fr; /* One layer for topbar, one layer for flexible content */
}
```

Next, we just need to bind each area to its corresponding position. Here, we can see a new syntax being used: [subgrid](https://caniuse.com/css-subgrid), which allows child elements' grids to inherit from the parent element's grid, eliminating the need to redefine the grid.

```css
.header-area {
  grid-area: 1 / 1 / 3 / 5;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
}

.topbar-area {
  height: var(--height-topbar);
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
  grid-area: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4;
}

.intro-area {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
  grid-area: 3 / 2 / 4 / 3;
}
.main-area {
  grid-area: 3 / 2 / 4 / 3;
}
.sidebar-area {
  grid-area: 2 / 3 / 4 / 4;
}
```

In actual projects, to ensure compatibility with older browsers, I redefine the same grid in the `header` area for alignment with other elements, which does not differ much; it‚Äôs just the same grid defined again.

Although it is rare to encounter such a special visual in theory, as far as I know, modern UI design software does not have corresponding means to create such drafts. It can only be conveyed by drawing two versions of flat drafts. This is a valuable experience that fully demonstrates the unique advantages of CSS Grid.
