## Introduction

Recently, a project I maintain hopes to introduce Dark Mode, but I believe it's not a cost-effective choice. This article discusses why I think so.

## What is Dark Mode?

> Dark Mode actually provides diversity in visual experience, but from a more functional perspective.

Many websites and applications now offer Dark Mode by default, which is a design approach that changes background colors to dark and foreground colors to light, featuring various functional and emotional characteristics, such as:

- Saving device power
- Reducing eye strain
- Enhancing product customization experience
- [Providing a more immersive user experience](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/dark-mode#Best-practices)

Today, both operating systems and browsers support Dark Mode, meeting people's demand for diverse visual experiences. Dark Mode can be a design trend, but its functionality goes far beyond that.

## The Cost of Dark Mode

Often, implementing Dark Mode is not simply about inverting existing colors; it **requires special adjustments to maintain good readability and recognition**, much like designing an entirely new style theme.

A real-world example that can be immediately understood is the [Web Dong Blog](https://www.webdong.dev/), where my website cards have not been specially adjusted for Light Mode ðŸ˜…. It can be observed that in a light environment, stronger colors (saturation, low brightness) are usually needed to stand out, while using bright color systems in Dark Mode can lead to the opposite effect.

## My Considerations for Dark Mode

I considered implementing Dark Mode during the initial production of my website because the content of this blog is expected to consist of a large amount of text. I hope users can choose a suitable reading environment, so I am willing to maintain an additional color system to achieve this goal.

## Why I Don't Choose Dark Mode?

Returning to the beginning, I do not support introducing Dark Mode in the recent project because:

- **Increased Costs**: Dark Mode will significantly increase development, design, and testing costs, slowing down product iteration and changes.
- **Unnecessary Experience**: The user base may not be interested in or benefit much from this feature.
- **Not cost-effective**: If the existing design system is not yet complete, rushing to prioritize different design style modes is not in line with the process.

## Conclusion

Dark Mode can be a design trend, but above all, it truly reflects care for users, which is the real reason this trend persists.
