## Introduction

I previously wrote an article about the [Map in ES6 JavaScript](https://www.webdong.dev/en/post/javascript-maps/). This time, let's discuss WeakMap and how it differs from Map.

![Comparison of Map and WeakMap methods](map-vs-weakmap.webp 'Comparison of WeakMap vs Map methods')

You will find that `WeakMap` has significantly fewer available methods compared to `Map`. This is because they fundamentally handle data differently: `Map` uses strong references, while `WeakMap` uses weak references.

## Characteristics of WeakMap

1. **Does not prevent keys from being garbage collected**: The weak reference mechanism makes WeakMap very useful in scenarios where you need to associate additional data without affecting the lifecycle of the original object, such as: [private variables](https://fitzgeraldnick.com/2014/01/13/hiding-implementation-details-with-e6-weakmaps.html), [adding additional information to objects (DOM elements, classes, packages) that can be automatically garbage collected](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap#associating_metadata)……
2. **Generally only objects can be used as keys**: It serves as a collection of weak pointers. Primitive values (like numbers, strings) are immutable in JavaScript and are not stored by reference, so the concept of weak references cannot be applied to them.
3. **Does not care about content and state**: `WeakMap` cannot know if the JavaScript engine has already garbage collected a certain item, so it cannot guarantee that all items in `WeakMap` are valid. It does not support accessing all contents, such as iterating over the contents.

## Conclusion

```js
let foo = { name: 'foo' };
const map = new Map();
map.set(foo, 'Hello');

foo = undefined;

map.forEach((value, key) => {
  console.log(key, value); // { name: 'foo' } 'Hello'
});

// Conclusion: Even if the key is cleared, the map still retains a reference to foo
// If you want the map to be cleared along with foo, you can use WeakMap
```

The design of WeakMap is intended to solve specific issues present in `Map` (avoiding memory leaks, allowing the garbage collector to automatically clean up data that is no longer needed), making it suitable to choose the appropriate data structure in the right scenarios.
