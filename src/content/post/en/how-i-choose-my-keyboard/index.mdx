## Introduction

I am a person with very low material desires; I only replace everyday items when they are worn out. It wasn't until my frequently used membrane keyboard broke that I started looking for a new keyboard. The process of selecting a new keyboard reminded me of some stories about choosing keyboards, prompting me to write this article.

## Software Engineers and Keyboards

As a software engineer, the hardware productivity tools I encounter daily are: keyboard, mouse, computer, monitor, chair, laptop, and large water cup (staying hydrated is very important), among which the keyboard is definitely the one I have the deepest emotional connection with, because it is the tool for my work! So I can really understand the feelings of keyboard enthusiasts. If you want to give a gift to an engineer, discussing these tools with them would definitely be a good idea.

I digress a bit. Anyway, due to my keyboard breaking, I was also curious whether different keyboards really make a difference in productivity, so I have bought mechanical keyboards a few times, mainly because:

- I heard that the typing feel is better and more diverse
- I heard that the lifespan is longer compared to membrane keyboards
- The appearance is usually more varied

If spending a bit more money to buy a beautiful and durable keyboard can enhance efficiency, then it is worth it. However, in my experience, this is not the case... I realized that many of these claims are just marketing tactics. After trying two or three mechanical keyboards, I still believe it is not worth it:

- The price is too high
- Encountered various problems in less than six months
- The differences between various keyboards are really not significant after getting used to them; the fresh experience only exists at the beginning

## Conclusion

When friends ask me for keyboard purchasing advice, I always recommend buying:

- Best-selling models
- Low-priced membrane keyboards (warranty is really not that important, because if a keyboard breaks, I am too lazy to repair or replace it)

Instead, I think about what fatal problems a 399 membrane keyboard might have? I can use it for three to four years, and usually, it only breaks because I accidentally spill water on it. For me, such a keyboard is already sufficient.
