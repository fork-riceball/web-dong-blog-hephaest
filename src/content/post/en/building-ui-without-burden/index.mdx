## What Problems Might You Encounter When Building Web UI?

As a front-end engineer, my recent work experience has shown me that many development issues still revolve around the appearance, behavior, or interaction aspects of the interface. For example: "drag-and-drop page elements," "calendar," "dropdown menu," "data list"... It's not that spending time on these aspects is inferior; they actually require experienced developers to create a reasonable structure through extensive research and consideration. For example, there are many things to pay attention to:

- Performance
- Accessibility
- Maintainability
- Testability
- Search Engine Optimization
- Cross-platform Compatibility
- Internationalization
- ...

It makes me sigh that the development and maintenance costs of customized UI are indeed too high for small teams. On one hand, there is a desire to "quickly launch products," while on the other hand, there is a hope for "high-quality practical results." The result is that doing the right thing is always very difficult. Compared to mature and well-established projects, UI work in newly started projects is heavier and faces more challenges. Here are a few examples:

- **Neglected Accessibility and Web Standards**: Accessibility is often considered an optional feature during development, but it is theoretically necessary for some people.
- **Lack of Documentation and Automation**: Without experience or time to plan for automated UI testing, one can only rely entirely on manual testing and pray that no functionality breaks.
- **Inability to Adapt to Web Changes**: Since users rarely view web pages on small devices, completely abandoning small sizes may seem easy in the short term, but in the long run, it may come at a higher cost (hardcoding style sizes in web pages is already uncommon).

## So How Can We Face These Problems?

**Developers and designers will need to adapt to the ever-changing ways of web**. For instance, when creating componentized UI, most developers should have a concept similar to Lego blocks. More specific guidelines, such as [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), are also quite popular and are expected to become industry standards.

Additionally, there are some necessary shortcuts that can help us suffer less and iterate products faster:

- **Keep Web UI Simple and Plain**: Good for quick responses; deepen brand style only after functionality is validated in the market. I believe that [boring UI can be good UX](https://uxengineer.com/blog/good-ux-boring-ui), and costs should be focused on the right areas: "solving user pain points."
- **Respect Browser Standards**: Although some standards are still confusing, inconsistent, or even incomplete, in the long run, browser standards are the true unchanging principles of web development.
- **Make Good Use of Existing Tools**: Libraries, style guides, headless UI, such as: [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), [headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) are all very solid foundations.
- **Automated Documentation Tools**: Plan to learn more about related tools when you have time, such as [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
