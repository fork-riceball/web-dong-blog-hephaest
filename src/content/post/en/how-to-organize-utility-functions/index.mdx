## Introduction

Recently, while maintaining a project, I found many common functions scattered throughout the project. So, I took the opportunity to organize a unified structural rule for the team to use. Many times, our impression of these common utility functions **only stays at the idea of moving them to a certain folder, but we don't have much thought on how to manage or maintain these functions, leading to many chaotic situations** such as:

- **Excessive abstraction**: The logic has been abstracted, but it seems to have little meaning, instead increasing the cost of understanding and maintenance.
- **Ambiguous naming**: Because they are too generic, the names are also very vague.
- **God-level functions**: A single function does too many things, making it difficult to maintain.

  The project I am working on uses a Monorepo structure, so there is a more complex development environment, but the
  general concept should not differ too much.
</Sidenote>

## Facing Real-World Problems

Based on the issues I encountered in the project:

- Some functions are not commonly used but are specifically abstracted into a global function library for management, resulting in useless abstraction.
- Some legacy code is named `parse.ts`, `format.ts`, etc., which obviously has an overly vague classification, making it difficult to find the desired functionality in the future.
- Functions that theoretically could be split into smaller functions are all written as a lump for convenience.

I must say that besides random naming, other issues likely have trade-offs behind them. Different people have different starting points and unknown backgrounds. I hope to establish a unified development rule so that team members can follow the rules and more easily find the desired utility functions to enhance the development experience.

During the process, I studied the organizational methods of different utility libraries, such as: [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/main/src), [radash](https://github.com/sodiray/radash/tree/master/src), [underscore](https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/tree/master/modules), [vueuse](https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse/tree/main/packages/core). The common point is that they are all very elegant and pure ðŸ˜…. They may not be able to provide suggestions for projects mixed with too much business logic, but I still observed, learned, and summarized the patterns.

## Definition of Utility Functions

- Small, reusable functions that perform specific common tasks.
- Functions that do not depend on specific contexts or states ([pure functions](/en/post/why-pure-function/)).

## When to Abstract Utility Functions

When you find that the actions performed by a function are repeated in different places, please abstract the function and manage it in the corresponding level repository, and import it when needed for unified management and tracking.

## Key Points for Managing Utility Functions

1. File names and function names should be named using camelCase.
2. Function names should clearly express the function's purpose.
3. Encourage pure functions and encourage adding tests.
4. At most one folder level to describe the function group.
5. Single responsibility and use verbs to describe functionality, split into small files for easy preview of functionality from the file name.
6. Make good use of existing utility libraries (`Lodash`, `date.js`), do not reinvent the wheel.
7. As little abstraction as possible.
   1. If it is not expected to be used very often, there is no need to abstract it.
   2. If it is expected to be used only in project `A`, only abstract it to the utility library of project `A`, do not abstract it to the global function library.
8. Must provide detailed comments documenting the function's purpose and record types through TypeScript.

## Practical Examples

Here are some examples for quick reference, which can give you a general understanding of the concept; actual applications may be more complex.

### How Utility Functions Should Be Defined

```ts
// libs/shared/utility/src/lib/thousandth.ts

/**
 * Convert a positive integer to a string with thousands separators
 *
 * @param number - integer, if no input is given, default is 0
 * @returns a string with thousands separators
 * @example thousandth(1000) // '1,000'
 */

export function thousandth(number: number) {
  const isInteger = Number.isInteger(number);
  if (isInteger) {
    return number.toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+$)/g, ',');
  } else {
    throw new RangeError('Input must be an integer');
  }
}
```

### Overall Folder Structure

I considered whether to place similar functionalities in the same file for unified output, but ultimately decided to keep them distinct. The reasons are:

1. It won't take too much time.
2. You can find the desired functionality just by looking at the folder structure.

```bash
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ dialog/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ showDialog.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hideDialog.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ date/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ transformToYYYYMMDD.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ cookie/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ getCookieExpiredAbsoluteTime.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ localStorage/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ getLocalStorage.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ setLocalStorage.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ removeLocalStorage.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ shadcn/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cn.ts
â””â”€â”€ tanstackTableVue/
    â””â”€â”€ valueUpdater.ts
```
