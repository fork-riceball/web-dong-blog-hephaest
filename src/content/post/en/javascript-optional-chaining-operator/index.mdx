## Introduction

Learning the optional chaining syntax allows us to safely access properties of nested objects without causing errors, even if those properties do not exist.

## The Problem of "Non-existent Properties"

Accessing object properties is a very intuitive task that developers do every day. However, when the source of data is unstable, such as when using data from third-party sources or user input, how can we avoid errors caused by using non-existent values?

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Doe',
  age: 28,
};

console.log(person.child.age); // Uncaught TypeError: person.child is undefined
```

We can use the [conditional operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) or the [logical operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND) to achieve this:

```javascript
// If person.name exists, use person.name, otherwise it equals undefined.
console.log(person.name ? person.name : undefined);

// If person exists, get person.name, otherwise it equals undefined
console.log(person && person.name);
```

Although this works, it is not a very elegant solution, and as the level of nesting increases, the code becomes more cumbersome.

```javascript
const person = {};

console.log(person.address ? (user.address.street ? user.address.street.name : null) : null);
```

## Using Optional Chaining .?

The solution to the above problem is simple: use [optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining). In short, if the input value does not exist or is `null`, the selected value will be treated as `undefined`, preventing the program from crashing. There are two usages:

1. Avoid crashing the program due to accessing non-existent values (if the value does not exist, it gets `undefined`)
2. Set default values (in conjunction with the `??` operator)

```javascript
const person = {};

// Gets undefined
console.log(person?.name);

// Gets default value "Unnamed User"
console.log(person?.name ?? 'Unnamed User');
```

This is typically used when accessing remote data or the DOM. If you are very sure that the data you are retrieving will definitely exist, you can omit it; including it adds an extra layer of exception protection.

Additionally, "chaining" optional chaining is also possible, as shown below:

```javascript
let user = {};

// Gets undefined
console.log(user?.address?.street);
```

## Notes

You should not overuse `?.` optional chaining; use it only for non-essential data selection. For example, when the `address` in the `user` object is non-essential, you can use `user.address?.street` to select it, rather than `user?.address?.street`.

Excessive use of optional chaining can lead to inappropriate timing warnings being suppressed, causing variables to be filled with `undefined` values, making debugging more difficult.
