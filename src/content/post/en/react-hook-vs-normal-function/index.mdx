## Introduction

Students from HexSchool Academy asked: "How do you distinguish between Hooks and methods? When is something called a Hook in React? When can it only be called a method?" This article aims to clarify these questions.

## What is React Hook?

You can start by looking at the [official React documentation](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html#but-what-is-a-hook):

> Allows you to 'hook into' React state and lifecycle features from function components.

In simple terms, React is a big machine, and through the Hook API, we can **interact with internal data and logic**. React simply calls their API Hooks, and that's it ðŸ˜Ž. Additionally, besides using the Hooks provided by React, you can also create your own Hooks by creating a JavaScript function that starts with "use" and follows the [rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html).

For example, if you're tired of using useEffect to call external APIs every time, you can create a custom Hook called [useFetch](https://www.30secondsofcode.org/react/s/use-fetch/) to eliminate repetitive code and organize this part of the logic into a single Hook.

## Conclusion

React Hook is the term for React's API, and a custom React Hook is a function that uses React Hooks.

- Functions within objects are usually referred to as "methods."
- React Hooks are React's API, used to interact with React.
- Custom React Hooks are functions that use React Hooks to write custom functionalities.
