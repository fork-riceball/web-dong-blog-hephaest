## Expressions

> An expression produces a value

- `1` produces the value `1`
- `你好` produces the value `你好`
- `5 * 10` produces the value `50`
- `age >= 18` produces the value `true` or `false`
- `isHappy ? "🙂" : "🙁"` produces the value `🙂` or `🙁`
- `(function () { return 'Hi'; }())` produces the value `Hi`
- `({a: 1})` produces the value `{a: 1}`

## Statements

> Perform actions to complete tasks

Statements are like commands; using them executes some predefined actions. Wherever there are statements, expressions can be input.

```js
// Assign `5` to the `age` variable
const age = 5;
```

```js
// If `age` is greater than or equal to 18, then execute ...
if (age >= 18) {
  // ...
}
```

## Expressions and Statements

An expression produces a value and can stand alone or as part of another statement. Additionally, in special cases, you may need to use [`()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Grouping#using_the_grouping_operator_to_eliminate_parsing_ambiguity) to wrap an expression; otherwise, JavaScript may incorrectly interpret it as a statement.

```js
// IIFE Immediately Invoked Function Expression
(function () {
  // ...
})();
```

```js
// Return Object
const f = () => ({ a: 1 });
```

## Summary

A simple way to distinguish between expressions and statements is to throw them into `console.log`. If there are no syntax errors and it can execute, it's an "expression"; otherwise, it's a "statement" (or simply invalid syntax). I later realized the importance of expressions and statements, especially with some peculiar restrictions when writing frameworks like React/JSX, such as: "only one element can be returned" and "why use expressions to write?". In reality, these are limitations of how JavaScript itself operates.
