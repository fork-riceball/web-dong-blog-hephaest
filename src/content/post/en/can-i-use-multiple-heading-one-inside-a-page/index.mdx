## Is It Compliant?

> Having multiple `<h1>` tags on a page is compliant syntax

According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#avoid_using_multiple_h1_elements_on_one_page): "Although using multiple `<h1>` tags on a page is accepted by HTML standards," and based on the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), having multiple `<h1>` tags on a page is 100% compliant syntax.

## Is It a Good Practice?

MDN also mentions that "[multiple `<h1>` elements should be avoided on the same page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#avoid_using_multiple_h1_elements_on_one_page)" because a page typically only has one `<h1>` to describe the content of the webpage.

However, Google, which has over 90% market share among search engines, states that "[multiple `<h1>` tags do not affect search engine interpretation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyqJJXWk0gk)," and we should focus more on the overall structure of the webpage. If regular website users can understand it, then search engines can too.

So what's the conclusion...?

> No definitive conclusion; the key is whether the overall title structure is reasonable when using multiple `<h1>` tags

The focus is not on "whether to use multiple `<h1>` tags" but on "whether users can understand the structure of the webpage." If the webpage structure is clear and reasonable, then using multiple `<h1>` tags will not affect SEO. It's quite rare to have many "major headings" on a single page, and if it's reasonable in terms of reading structure, using multiple `<h1>` tags on a single page is perfectly fine.
