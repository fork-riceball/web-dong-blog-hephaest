## Discovering the Problem

In JavaScript, there are two common methods to compare values:

- [Loose equality ==](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality)
- [Strict equality ===](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality)

The difference between the two is that loose equality performs type conversion, while strict equality does not. For example, `1 == '1'` converts the string to a number before comparison, thus returning `true`, while `1 === '1'` strictly compares the types, returning `false`.

So what potential problems can this small difference cause?

Using loose comparisons can make the conditions in your code ambiguous. For instance, in the following code, it is clear that `0` and `''` are not equal. However, because loose comparison is used, this coding style makes the code less rigorous, so it is recommended to use strict comparison.

```javascript
0 == ''; // true
0 == '0'; // true
0 == false; // true
```

## Summary

Whenever possible, use `===` instead of `==`. It’s better to write stricter conditions from the start. Since `==` does not check types, it often leads to bugs due to JavaScript's automatic type conversion. For example:

```jsx
const a = 1;
const b = '1';

typeof a; // Number
typeof b; // String

a == b; // true
a === b; // false

// In terms of type, a and b are different, but JavaScript converts them during comparison, so using === is a stricter requirement for "types to be the same."
```

In most cases, you won’t want to use loose equality, but in certain situations, it might be more convenient, such as when comparing `null` and `undefined`, because their values are equal but their types are different. In this case, using `==` can be more convenient, allowing you to check both `null` and `undefined` at once:

```javascript
// Write a condition: when a is null or undefined, it will enter the if statement.

// Using loose comparison
if (a == null) {
}
// Using strict comparison
if (a === null || a === undefined) {
}
```

For a detailed comparison of the differences between the two, you can refer to the MDN documentation: [Understanding Equality Comparison](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness#%E7%90%86%E8%A7%A3%E7%9B%B8%E7%AD%89%E6%AF%94%E8%BC%83%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B) which is very comprehensive.
