What Happens After Entering a URL in the Browser?

- 1. DNS Resolution Phase (Obtain Target Server IP)
  - Check if there is a DNS cache available
  - Query the local DNS server provided by the ISP
- 2. TCP Connection Establishment (Establish Connection with Target Server)
  - Initiate TCP connection request to the target IP address
  - Perform TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
- 3. TLS/SSL Encrypted Connection (Establish Encrypted Connection with Target Server)
  - Perform handshake and exchange encryption keys
  - Validate certificates
- 4. Request and Response (Retrieve Web Content)
  - The browser sends a request to the server
  - The server processes the request and returns resources
  - The browser begins to receive and parse resources
- 5. Browser Rendering Page (Render Web Page)
  - Parse HTML to create DOM Tree
  - Parse CSS to create CSSOM Tree
  - Combine DOM and CSSOM to create Render Tree
  - Calculate element positions and sizes (Layout)
  - Paint the page content (Paint)
  - Divide the page into multiple layers (Layering)
  - Convert layers to pixels (Rasterization)
  - GPU composites multiple layers (Compositing)

Depending on the position, one can gradually identify the areas of interest through communication. For instance, front-end developers may be eager to learn more about how browsers operate. I believe back-end friends also have different focal points on this topic.
