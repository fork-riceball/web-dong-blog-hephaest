A web page designed with accessibility in mind, similar to the concept of accessible facilities, considers the needs of users with different physical abilities and environmental experiences. For example, visually impaired or keyboard users may need websites to have appropriate visual processing or other assistive indicators to ensure that the website information can be correctly conveyed and interacted with, as previously discussed:

- [What Do Websites Look Like to Different Types of Colorblind Eyes?](https://www.webdong.dev/en/shortpost/color-blind-website-preview/#color-blind-website-preview)

Accessible web pages are special measures for specific minority groups? Not entirely.

Related to physical degeneration, harsh environments, limited hardware and preferences, etc., ultimately, accessible web pages consider creating an inclusive user experience, ensuring that everyone can use the web equally and smoothly.
Finally, I would like to share [WhoCanUse](https://www.whocanuse.com/?bg=533399&fg=ffffff&fs=16&fw=), a website that simulates the differences in experiences of the same button for different types of visual impairments or environmental simulations.
