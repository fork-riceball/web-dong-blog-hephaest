Using relative path `import` for another file is usually not a big issue, but as the project scales, the relationships between files become more complex, leading to the following problems:

1. File paths become too nested and hard to understand
2. `import` represents different paths in different files

Therefore, an alias such as `@` or `~` is set to point to the project root, allowing the use of absolute path imports. You can refer to the relevant documentation for [Vite](https://vite.dev/config/shared-options#resolve-alias) and [rollup/plugin-alias](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/alias#entries).
