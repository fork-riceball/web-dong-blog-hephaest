Have you ever been curious about the development process behind a package? Recently, I followed a video by Matt Pocock to create a package and publish it to NPM. The best part is that many steps are automated, saving a lot of effort:

1. Use tsup to convert ts to esm and cjs module formats
2. Use changeset to manage changelog and version updates
3. Use GitHub Actions to automate the CI/CD process

You can refer to my experience: [Writing an Automated Semantic Versioning TypeScript NPM Package](https://www.webdong.dev/post/auto-publish-typescript-package-with-semver-to-npm/). Later, I wrote a TS package for public release: [edit-element](https://github.com/riceball-tw/edit-element). I also tried out Playwright for E2E testing.
