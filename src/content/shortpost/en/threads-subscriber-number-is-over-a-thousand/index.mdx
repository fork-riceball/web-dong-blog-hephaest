WebDong is my web development blog, and after writing 95 short articles, I have surpassed 1000 followers! So here's an update on my recent activities:

- Wrote over 200 long and short articles
- AI-assisted translation of multilingual articles (currently a total of 116 articles)
- Launched a web toolbox to collect resources related to web development

About 2 months ago, I quit my job to focus on learning:

- English speaking and writing
- Backend development, and I am preparing to start a new job early next year. If you have web development topics or just want to practice English speaking, feel free to chat.
