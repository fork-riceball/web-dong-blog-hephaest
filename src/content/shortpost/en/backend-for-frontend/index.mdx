Understanding that BFF is an extension of the API Gateway Pattern, it is essentially a proxy architecture for APIs, designed to meet the diverse needs of front-end applications with a dedicated back-end (focusing on business logic, data integration, transformation, and trimming).

For example, when multiple front-ends need to request data from various services, issues may arise:

1. The front-end is either tightly coupled with multiple back-end services (leading to high dependency) or uses overly generic APIs (which cannot meet specific needs).
2. Frequent communication with different services is required.
3. Security issues (exposing specific service endpoints).

At this point, adding an extra layer of BFF can centralize all communications and provide the most suitable APIs for front-end use, but it also introduces additional problems:

1. Increased complexity.
2. Increased latency.
3. Higher potential for single points of failure.

If the complexity of front-end and back-end services reaches a certain level, creating a BFF is an option to solve the problem. Many modern frameworks like Next or Nuxt have full-stack capabilities, making them a good option for quick adoption. They also allow the team handling the client to take over the BFF, reducing maintenance costs and improving development efficiency.
