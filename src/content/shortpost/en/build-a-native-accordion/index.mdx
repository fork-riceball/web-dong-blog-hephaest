An accordion typically refers to a UI pattern with a series of vertically stacked headings that can expand and collapse different information. In the past, this required JavaScript to manage the open and close states and animation.

Fortunately, HTML has a new syntax `<details>` and `<summary>` that helps us quickly achieve similar functionality, along with new CSS properties like `interpolate-size` and `transition-behavior` to create smooth expand and collapse animations.

I read the relevant documentation and created a minimal viable accordion with animation. It's worth noting that the animation-related syntax is primarily supported by Chromium-based browsers, making it a nice feature to progressively enhance.
