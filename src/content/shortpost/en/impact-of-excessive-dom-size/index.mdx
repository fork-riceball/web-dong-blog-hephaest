You may notice that Lighthouse will issue a warning when the page content exceeds 800 nodes and an error when it exceeds 1400 nodes.

In addition to paying attention to the number of nodes, the depth of the DOM and CSS styles can also profoundly affect the efficiency of web page rendering. Keeping the web structure simple and clean is the best solution.

In situations where displaying a large number of DOM nodes is unavoidable, consider using Virtual Scrolling techniques to avoid displaying all data at once. The general idea is to only render items that are visible within the viewport.
