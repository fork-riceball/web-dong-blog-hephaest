Unintentionally, many articles I translated last year started from [daily.dev](https://daily.dev/), a browser extension and PWA that can be used in any environment. I remember seeing it recommended by Fireship, so I downloaded it to check it out, and gradually developed the habit of consuming development articles from different sources every day.

Free, open-source, diverse themes, and an active community, definitely worth a try!
