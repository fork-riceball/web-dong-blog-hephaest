![Object.keys error example](object-keys-error.png)

As indicated by the error message in the image, `person` needs to accept specific values for `key` rather than any `string`. So what is the reason behind `Object.keys` returning a more wide `string[]` type? It is obvious that all `key` types can be derived through `keyof`?

Because JavaScript objects can “dynamically change their content at runtime.”

If `Object.keys` were designed to return `(keyof T)[]`, that type definition would not accurately reflect the changes that JavaScript objects may encounter at runtime. Since object properties can be dynamically modified, TypeScript chooses to use the more wider `string[]` type to ensure safety.

Conclusion: TypeScript respects the dynamic typing characteristics of JavaScript, which leads to `Object.keys` being able to guarantee a return type of at most `string[]`.

Details of the analysis and references, along with three coping strategies, are written in the blog: [Why Object.keys returns string[] in TypeScript](https://www.webdong.dev/post/why-object-keys-returns-array-of-strings-in-typescript/)
