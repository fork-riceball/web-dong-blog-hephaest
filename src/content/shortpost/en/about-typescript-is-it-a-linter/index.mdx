By definition, the term Linter usually refers to a tool for static code analysis that checks for specific writing styles. For example, ESLint is the most widely used Linter in the JS ecosystem, helping you check for anti-patterns or dead and outdated code, among other things.

When it comes to TypeScript, it is often imagined as a separate language that requires learning. This idea previously caused me a lot of doubts before adopting or learning it.

TypeScript's non-invasive design allows it to coexist with JS. As a superset of JS, explaining TS from a Linter's perspective becomes much easier, as TS is essentially JS but with type checks.

It can be easily adopted and just as easily removed. Writing TS is equivalent to writing JS, but it requires you to have an understanding of types and commit to maintenance. It is essential for medium to large projects.
