Recently, during an interview, I was asked how I can consistently maintain the habit of writing a technical blog. Do I have any tips? Here are my thoughts:

## 1. Reduce Friction

If there are a lot of trivial tasks before starting something, I would rather give up. It's crucial to understand how to build a productive environment and eliminate distractions.

- Before exercising, everything should be prepared in advance for easy access.
- Similarly, when writing, I should spend minimal effort to deploy progress, so I set up automated processes for the blog to focus on what truly matters.

## 2. Just Take Action

Once you get into the flow, your body will respond actively. Set a minimum output for those lazy moments and allow yourself to accept lower productivity.

- If I'm too lazy to exercise, I'll go for a light walk; who knows, I might just get into the mood.
- Similarly, when I'm extremely lazy to write or learn something, I'll translate an old article, which also helps me practice English.

## 3. Understand What You Are Pursuing

Motivation is subjectively formed. Pursuing money, fame, or knowledge is reasonable, but one should not blindly chase after or be trapped by formalized results.

- Is exercising for health? External validation? Or is it a profitable business?
- I believe writing is a refinement of thought; I'm not pursuing a high volume of articles or seeking praise from many people, but rather I continue writing because I deeply understand certain concepts and glad to share it.
