It can be said that it is actually a collection of various UI trends:

- Dark mode
- Gradients
- Grids
- Glassmorphism
- Bento Grid

What do people on the internet call this style? It's quite interesting:

- Generic-modern-futuristic
- "Programmers will like this" style
- Post-Bootstrapism
- Linear design
