During a previous interview, I was asked about a SPA website I created early on, where the image loading experience was not very good after page transitions. I shared all the answers I could think of ðŸ˜…, and while I managed to answer a bit, I wasn't very confident since I hadn't used them much. My responses included:

- Images should have width and height set to avoid CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- Images can add a skeleton or loader to indicate loading
- Initially display smaller images, replacing them with the actual larger images at the right time
- Images can use `fetchpriority` to prioritize resource loading
- Inline SVG or data URI can be used for images
- Use preload to pre-load critical images...?

So I revisited the relevant documents to understand how browsers optimize resource loading through the following methods:

- preload
- prefetch
- dns-prefetch
- preconnect
